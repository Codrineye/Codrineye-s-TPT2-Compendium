A script has 2 states, enabled or disabled. If disabled, the scripts name will be colored red and crossed out, these effects are removed once the script is enabled, by either checking the "enabled" box or by right clicking on the script.

It also contains a seperate settings menu, in which you can toggle `Fast Atomic Functions`, change the amount of cycles the game is alowed to stay on, toggle global variables on or off, toggle active scripts on or off
