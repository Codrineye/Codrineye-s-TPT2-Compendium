# AI Functions

AI Functions are blocks used when writing scripts.<br>
This is a list of all of them, separated according to the function type

For space, I've created the groups `data_type`, `buildings`, `factory_machines`, `adventure_entities`, `museum_storage`, `resources`, `elements`, `digits` and `letters`. When you see these, just know that the specified action works for for all items in its coresponding list:

`data_type` = `bool`, `double`, `int`, `string`, `vector`

`buildings` = "arcade", "construction firm", "factory", "headquarters", "laboratory", "mine", "museum", "power plant", "shipyard", "statue of cubos", "trading post", "workshop"

`factory_machines` = "oven", "assembler", "refinery", "crusher", "cutter", "presser", "mixer", "shaper", "boiler"

`adventure_entities` = "Chest", "Bomb", "Rock", "Door", "Enemy", "Elite", "Mimic"

`museum_storage` = "inventory", "loadout", "combinator", "cuboscube"

`resources` = "gameTokens", "town.resources", "gems", "gems.exotic", "powerplant.resources", "mine.resources", "factory.resources", "headquarters.resources", "arcade.resources", "laboratory.resources", "shipyard.resources", "tradingpost.resources", "workshop.resources", "museum.resources", "constructionFirm.resources", "statueofcubos.resources", "halloween.pumpkins", "halloween.souls", "halloween.blood", "christmas.cookies", "christmas.presents", "christmas.reindeers.trained", "christmas.reindeers.milk", "christmas.reindeers.raw", "christmas.milk", "christmas.trees", "christmas.wrappings", "christmas.toys", "christmas.candy", "time.offline"

`elements` = "fire", "water", "earth", "air", "nature", "light", "darkness", "electricity", "universal", "neutral"

`digits` = `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`

`letters` = `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `m`, `n`, `o`, `p`, `q`, `r`, `s`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `w`, `x`, `y`, `z`

The functions are written in the [External AI Editor](https://d0sboots.github.io/perfect-tower/) format first, and then written in the internal editor format in `[square brackets]`

There are 4 types of functions:

- [Impulse functions](#impulse-functions)
- [Conditional functions](#conditional-functions)
- [Atomic functions](#atomic-functions)
- [Fundamental functions](#fundamental-functions)

This post is within its own subject on my [Compendium faq posts](AI%20Functions.md), where you can find the data types and functions in their own separate subjects.

## Impulse functions

An impulse lets you activate your script by performing an action.<br>
You cannot trigger an impulse if the AI Overlay is inactive.

wakeup() `[impulse wakeup]`<br>
activate the script when the AI Overlay is activated.

newround() `[impulse newround]`<br>
activate the script when you start a game of towertesting.

open.buildings() `[impulse open: buildings]`<br>
activate the script when you enter the respective buildings.

close.buildings() `[impulse close: buildings]`<br>
activate the script when you exit the respective buildings.

mouse.0.down() `[impulse mouse: left down]`<br>
activate the script when your left mouse button is pressed down.

mouse.0.up() `[impulse mouse: left up]`<br>
activate the script when your left mouse button is no longer being pressed down.

mouse.1.down() `[impulse mouse: right down]`<br>
activate the script when your right mouse button is pressed down.

mouse.1.up() `[impulse mouse: right up]`<br>
activate the script when your right mouse button is no longer being pressed down.

mouse.2.down() `[impulse mouse: middle down]`<br>
activate the script when your middle mouse button is pressed down.

mouse.2.up() `[impulse mouse: middle up]`<br>
activate the script when your middle mouse button is no longer being pressed down.

key._digits_() `[impulse key: `_digits_`]`<br>
activate the script when you press the respective number key.

key._letters_() `[impulse key: `_letters_`]`<br>
activate the script when you press the respective letter key.

## Conditional functions

A condition is computed by the script before executing any actions.<br>
If any of the conditions returns false, the script will terminate without execution.

There is a bug in how conditions handle script termination. If a script calls another script using [executesync()](#fundemental-functions), and the called script has a false condition, the called script will terminate itself. However, the calling script incorrectly continues to treat the called script as still running.

## Permited operators

### Boolean

- `==`, `=` means equal
- `!=` means not equal
- `&&`, `&` means and
- `||`, `|` means or

### Int/Double

- `==`, `=` means equal
- `!=` means not equal
- `<` means smaller than
- `<=` means smaller or equal than
- `>` means larger than
- `>=` means larger or equal than

### String

- `==`, `=` means equal
- `!=` means not equal

## Conditions

Subject is isolated in the section [R data type bool](./Data%20Types/Type%20Bool.md).<br>
All conditions are the same values as [R type: bool](#type-bool)

comparison.*data_type*(*data_type*, "operator", *data_type*)
`[comparison: `*data_type*`type: `*data_type*`, type: string, type: `*data_type*`]`<br>
Compares two values of the same *data_type* (excluding vector) based on the selected operator.

External editor specification.<br>
comparison.*data_type*(*data_type*, "operator", *data_type*) is long-form for c.*data_type*, where data_type in this context means:
```
c.b = comparison.bool
c.d = comparison.double
c.i = comparison.int
c.s = comparison.string
```
I recommend using the long-form for code clarity when you use this primitive function.<br>
arithmetic.double(value1, "operation", value2) is a primitive.<br>
Primitive operations do not get pre-computed when exporting the code.
```
var1 = arithmetic.bool(true, "==", true) ; after export var1 = true == true
var2 = true == true ; after export var2 = true
```

When in the form that gets pre-computed, you lose the `=` comparison operator.
```
var1 = comparison.bool(true, "=", true) ; valid syntax
var2 = true = true ; syntax error.
```


global.bool.get("variable name") `[global: get (bool) type: string]`<br>
Returns the value of the global bool variable with the coresponding name.

local.bool.get("variable name") `[local: get (bool) type: string]`<br>
Returns the value of the local bool variable with the coresponding name<br>
please keep in mind that the value of a local bool will always be false on script activation.

stunned() `[tower: is stunned]`<br>
Returns true if the tower is stunned. Returns false if the tower is not stunned or if towertesting is not active.

isTowerTesting() `[game: is tower testing]`<br>

Returns true if a boss fight is currently active. Returns false otherwise.

contains(string1, string2) `[string: contains type: string, type: string]`<br>
Returns true if string1 contains the same character sequence of string2.

```
contains("foo", "oo") → true: "oo" is part of "foo".
contains("foo", "foo") → true: "foo" matches "foo" entirely.
contains("foo", "fooo") → false: "fooo" exceeds the length of "foo".
contains("foo", "a") → false: "a" is not part of "foo".

contains("", "") → true: an empty string contains an empty string
contains("foo", "") → true: An empty string is considered part of a string.
contains("", "foo") → false: an empty string does not contain any characters.
```

not(bool value) `[bool: not type: bool]`<br>
Returns the opposite of the given bool value. not(true) = false; not(false) = true.

mouse.0.state() `[mouse: left]`<br>

Returns true if the inputed [town window](#fundemental-functions) is active and visible on the screen.

anyopen() `[town: any window open]`<br>
Returns true if any window or menu in town is open.

worker.paused("worker name") `[worker: is paused type: string]`<br>

Returns the current market preference for the element with id `element name`.

museum.isSlotLocked(offer Slot) `[museum: market lock type: int]`<br>
Returns the lock state of market slot `offer Slot`.

## Atomic functions

An atomic function is an action that consumes 0 from your execution budget.

goto(line number) `[basic: goto type: int]`<br>
Jumps to specified `line number` of the script. Line 1 is the first action in your script.<br>
Any number bellow 1 is treated as 1, any number above your actions count will terminate the script.

gotoif(line number, condition) `[basic: goto-if type: int, type: bool]`<br>
Same as a goto() but if your condition is false it continues to the next line instead of jumping to the line number.

global.*data_type*.set("variable name", value) `[global: set (`*data_type*`) type: string, type: `*data_type*`]`<br>
Assigns the inputed `value` inside the global variable `variable name`.

global.unset("variable name") `[global: unset type: string]`<br>
Deletes the global variable with the name `variable name`. Note that unsetting a global variable will have strange side effects to the global values overlay.

local.*data_type*.set("variable name", value) `[local: set (`*data_type*`) type: string, type: `*data_type*`]`<br>
Assigns the inputed `valuse` inside of the local variable `variable name`.

local.unset("variable name") `[local: unset type: string]`<br>
Deletes the local variable with the name `variable name`.


External Editor syntactic sugar.<br>
The `line number` inside of goto and gotoif can be replaced with a label.<br>
A label is an identifier that gets computed to the line number corresponding to the position in your code.<br>
This is defined as a string that can contain any letter, number, `_` or `.` inside of it and ends once you place a `:` in the string.<br>
The first character in a label can not be a number or a `.`.

```
goto(0)
; is equivalent to
top:
goto(top)
```

### type: double

Subject is isolated in the section [R Data Type double](./Data%20Types/Type%20Double.md).

A double is any value between -1.7976931348623157E+308 to 1.7976931348623157E+308.

External Editor syntactic sugar.<br>
:const double `var_name` <double_value><br>
Defines a variable with the name "var_name" that can hold the given double value.<br>
Since this is a const definition, you can not assign a value to this after it's been defined.

The value of a const definition cannot be an expression.

:global double `var_name`<br>
Defines a variable with the name "var_name".<br>
This shortens the assignment and retrieval expressions of the global variable called `var_name`.

```
:global double test
global.double.set("test", global.double.get("test"))
; is the long form of
test = test
```

:local double `var_name`<br>
Is the same as :global bool `var_name` but instead of a global variable, this defines a local variable.

arithmetic.double(value1, "operation", value2) `[arithmetic type: double, type: string, type: double]`<br>
Performs arithmetic on the inputed values.<br>
Permited operations are:

- `^` `pow` power
- `//` `log` logarithm<br>
  a // b = log base b of a
- `*` `x` multiplication
- `/` `:` division
- `%` `mod` modulo
- `+` addition
- `-` subtraction

External Editor specifications:<br>
arithmetic.double is long-form for a.d(). The syntax is the same, however this is shorter.<br>
I recommend using the long-form for code clarity when you use this primitive function.<br>
arithmetic.double(value1, "operation", value2) is a primitive.<br>
Primitive operations do not get pre-computed when exporting the code.
```
var1 = arithmetic.double(1.0, "+", 1.0) ; after export var1 = 1.0 + 1.0
var2 = 1.0 + 1.0 ; after export var2 = 2.0
```
Additionally, when assigning a variable, you can use a prefix operation to shorten the expression.
```
var1 = var1 + 1.0
var2 += 1.0
; both get compiled to the same operation
```
However, assignment prefixes are performed last
```
var2 = var2 * 2.0 + 1.0
; can not be converted to
var2 *= 2.0 + 1.0 ; translates to var2 = var2 * 3.0 because it's treated as var2 = var2 * (2.0 + 1.0)
```

When in a form that gets pre-computed, you lose the operators `pow`, `log`, `x`, `:` and `mod`
```
var1 = arithmetic.double(2.0, "x", 5.0) ; valid syntax
var2 = 2.0 x 5.0 ; invalid syntax
```

Subject is isolated in the section [R data type int](./Data%20Types/Type%20Int.md).

An integer value is any number between -2147483648 to 2147483647.

External Editor syntactic sugar.<br>
:const int `var_name` <int_value><br>
Defines a variable with the name "var_name" that can hold the given integer value.<br>
Since this is a const definition, you can not assign a value to this variable after it's been defined.

The value of a const definition cannot be an expression.

:global int `var_name`<br>
Defines a variable with the name "var_name".<br>
This shortens the assignment and retrieval of the variable.
```
:global int test
global.int.set("test", global.int.get("test"))

I recommend using the long-form for code clarity when you use this primitive function.<br>
arithmetic.int(value1, "operation", value2) is a primitive.<br>
Primitive operations do not get pre-computed when exporting the code.
```
var1 = arithmetic.int(1, "+", 1) ; after export var1 = 1 + 1
var2 = 1 + 1 ; after export var2 = 2
```
Additionally, when assigning a variable, you can use a prefix operation to shorten the expression.
```
var1 = var1 + 1
var2 += 1
; both get compiled to the same operation
```
However, assignment prefixes are performed last
```
var2 = var2 * 2 + 1
; can not be converted to
var2 *= 2 + 1 ; translates to var2 = var2 * 3 because it's treated as var2 = var2 * (2 + 1)
```

In a form that gets pre-computed, you lose the operators `pow`, `log`, `x`, `:` and `mod`.
```
var1 = arithmetic.int(10, "pow", 2) ; valid syntax
var2 = 10 pow 2 ; syntax error
```

index("Text", "T", 0) = 0
index("Text", "T", 1) = -1
```

len(str) `[string: length type: string]`<br>

### type: string

Subject is isolated in the section [R data type string](./Data%20Types/Type%20String.md).

External Editor syntactic sugar.<br>
A string value is a set of characters, numbers and special characters that must be contained in a pair of single quotes `''` or double quotes `""`.<br>
```
"test'" and 'test"' are valid
; however
"test"" and 'test'' are invalid
```

:const string `var_name` <string_value><br>
Defines a variable with the name "var_name" that can hold the given string value.<br>
Since this is a const definition, you can not assign a value to this variable after it's been defined.

The value of a const definition cannot be an expression.

:global string `var_name`<br>
Defines a variable with the name "var_name".<br>
This shortens the assignment and retrieval of the variable.
```
:global string test
global.string.set("test", global.string.get("test"))
; is long form of
test = test
```

:local string `var_name`<br>
Is the same as :global string `var_name` but instead of a global variable, this defines a local variable.<br>

adventure.entityType(position) `[adventure: get entity type type: vector(2d)]`<br>
Returns the entity type of the tile corresponding to the inputed position.<br>
The returned value is of `adventure_entities` and also returns an empty string if the entity is a wall or an empty tile.

concat(str, str) `[concat type: string, type: string]`<br>
Chains the two given strings together.<br>
External editor specifications.<br>
concat(str, str) is a primitive that doesn't pre-computed. Its short-form version is `str . str`.
```
var1 = concat("test", "test") ; gets exported as var1 = "test" . "test"
var2 = "test" . "test" ; gets exported as var2 = "testtest"
```

d2s(val) `[convert: double type: double]`<br>
Converts the inputed double to a string.

This function has been made obselete ever since the factory drop-downs were introduced.

machine.item(factory_machines) `[factory: machine input type: string]`<br>
Returns the id of the item currently inside the factory machine with the inputed ID.<br>
Accepted ID's are written in factory_machines, found at the [top of file](#ai-functions).

active.id(index) `[game: active module id type: int]`<br>
Returns the id of the active module in slot `index` in the active modules list where 1 refers to the first module in the list. Returns an empty string if the slot index is invalid or towertesting is not active.

museum.slotElement(offerSlot) `[museum: market element type: int]`<br>

Returns the PowerStone element in the requested trashSlot.

impulse() `[script: triggered impulse]`<br>
Returns the ID of the impulse that triggered this script instance. If the script was triggered by another script then this function will return the name of that script, including the package if present.

software.find(name) `[software: find id type: string]`<br>
Returns the correct software id of the software with the closest match to the inputed name (ignores case-sensitivity). This function is very slow. Avoid using it in performance critical sections.<br>
As with factory.find(name), this function has been made obselete ever since the software drop-downs were introduced.

lower(str) `[string: to lower]`<br>
Converts the inputed string into its lowercase variant.

### type: bool

All boolean values are [conditional functions](#conditional-functions).<br>
Subject is isolated in the section [R Data Type bool](./Data%20Types/Type%20Bool.md).

External Editor syntactic sugar.<br>
:const bool `var_name` true/false<br>
Defines a variable with the name "var_name" that can hold the values true or false.<br>
Since this is a const definition, you can not assign a value to this variable after it's been defined.

The value of a const definition cannot be an expression.

:global bool `var_name`<br>
Defines a variable with the name "var_name".<br>
This shortens the assignment and retrieval of the variable.
```
:global bool test
global.bool.set("test", global.bool.get("test"))
; is the long form of
test = test
```

:local bool `var_name`<br>
Is the same as :global bool `var_name` but instead of a global variable this defines a local variable

### type: vector(2d)

Subject is isolated in the section [R data type vector (2D)](./Data%20Types/Type%20Vector%20(2D).md).

External Editor syntactic sugar.<br>
A vector value is defined as `vec(value_x, value_y)`.<br>
while value_x and value_y are categorised as double values, they are of data type float, so performing the same operation between 2 double values and 2 vector values can lead to different results.

:const vector `var_name` <vector_value><br>
Defines a variable with the name "var_name" that can hold the given vector value.<br>
Since this is a const definition, you can not assign a value to this variable after it's been defined.

The value of a const definition cannot be an expression.

:global vector `var_name`<br>
Defines a variable with the name "var_name".<br>
This shortens the assignment and retrieval of the variable.
```
:global vector test
global.vec2.set("test", global.vec2.get("test"))
; is long form of
test = test
```

:local vector `var_name`<br>
Is the same as :global vector `var_name` but instead of a global variable, this defines a local variable.

adventure.playerPos() `[adventure: player position]`<br>
Returns the players current position in Adventure.<br>
If the arcade is closed or the adventure tab in arcade is not in focus, this returns vec(0.0, 0.0).

adventure.roomCoords() `[adventure: room coordinates]`<br>
Returns the coordinates of the current room in Adventure.<br>
If the arcade is closed or the adventure tab in arcade is not in focus, this returns vec(0.0, 0.0).

arithmetic.vec2(val, "operation", val) `[arithmetic type: vector (2D), type: string, type: vector (2D)]`<br>
Performs arithmetic on the components of the 2 inputed values.<br>
Permited operators are:

- `*` multiplication
- `/` division
- `+` addition
- `-` subtraction

External Editor specifications:<br>
arithmetic.vec2 is long-form for a.v(). The syntax is the same, however this is shorter.<br>
I recommend using the long-form for code clarity when you use this primitive function.<br>
arithmetic.vec2(value1, "operation", value2) is a primitive.<br>
Primitive operations do not get pre-computed when exporting the code.
```
var1 = arithmetic.vec2(vec(1.0, 0.0), "+", vec(1.0, 0.0)) ; after export var1 = vec(1.0, 0.0) + vec(1.0, 0.0)
var2 = vec(1.0, 0.0) + vec(1.0, 0.0) ; after export var2 = vec(2.0, 0.0)
```
Additionally, when assigning a variable, you can use a prefix operation to shorten the expression.
```
var1 = var1 + vec(1.0, 0.0)
var2 += vec(1.0, 0.0)
; both get compiled to the same operation
```
However, assignment prefixes are performed last
```
var2 = var2 * vec(2.0, 1.0) + vec(1.0, 0.0)
; can not be converted to
var2 *= vec(2.0, 1.0) + vec(1.0, 0.0) ; translates to var2 = var2 * vec(3.0, 1.0) because it's treated as var2 = var2 * (vec(2.0, 1.0) + vec(1.0, 0.0))
```

mouse.position() `[mouse: position]`<br>
Returns the current position of the mouse cursor.

if(cond, valTrue, valFalse) `[ternary: vector (2d) type: bool, type: vector (2d), type: vector (2d)]`<br>
If cond is true, returns valTrue, otherwise returns valFalse.
```
if(true, vec(1.0, 1.0), vec(0.0, 0.0)) = vec(1.0, 1.0)
if(false, vec(1.0, 1.0), vec(0.0, 0.0)) = vec(0.0, 0.0)
```

vec(value_x, value_y) `[vector2: from coordinates type: double, type: double]`<br>
Returns a vector with the inputed value_x and value_y.<br>
External editor specifications:<br>
If either value_x or value_y can't be pre-computed, the export uses vector2: from coordinates, otherwise, it uses the simple vector (2D).

## Fundamental functions

A fundamental function is an action that consumes 100 budget from your execution budget.<br>
These are the actions used to interact with the game.

click(clickPosition) `[basic: click type: vector(2D)]`<br>
Performs a click in the inputed position. If that position has a button, it will interact with it.

slider(sliderPosition, slide) `[basic: slider type: vector(2D), type: double]`<br>
Sets the slider at position `sliderPosition` on the screen to `slide`. Where 0.0 is the leftmost and 1.0 is the rightmost end.

scrollbar(scrollbarPosition, horisontal, vertical) `[basic: scrollrect type: vector(2D), type: double, type: double]`<br>
Scrolls within the scrollable container at `scrollbarPosition` to `horisontal` and `vertical`. Where 0 is the left/lower end and 1 being the right/upper end.<br>
Using a negative value ignores the axis entirely.
```
scrollbar(vec(0.0),  1, -1) ; only scrolls horisontally
scrollbar(vec(0.0), -1,  1) ; only scrolls vertically
scrollbar(vec(0.0),  1,  1) ; scrolls both horisontally and vertically
```

wait(ammount) `[basic: wait type: double]`<br>
Waits for the inputed ammount of seconds.<br>
Inputting a negative value acts as tho you inputed 0.<br>
Inputting any non-0 value will consume the rest of your execution budget.

waituntil(cond) `[basic: wait until type: bool]`<br>
Waits for as long as the inputed condition `cond` is false.<br>
Inputting a true condition only consumes 100 budget, inputting a false condition consumes all of your budget.

waitwhile(cond) `[basic: wait while type: bool]`<br>
Waits for as long as the inputed condition `cond` is true.<br>
Inputting a false condition only consumes 100 budget, inputting a true condition consumes all of your budget.

waitframe() `[basic: wait frame]`<br>
Consumes all of your budget.

execute(script_name) `[basic: execute type: string]`<br>
Executes the script with the name script_name without the called script needing a user impulse.<br>
The executed script will not be able to run if its script conditions are not met.<br>
If execute() is used in a package, the scripts within the package will first be checked to see if they match the inputed script_name, if none of them do, the search will continue from the top of the scripts.<br>
When calling a script from a package that we're not in, script_name must also include the package_name, followed by the `:` marker and then the script_name.
```
execute("me") ; executes the script called me within my package first, if none is found, looks at the other scripts
execute("package:me") ; executes the script called "me" from the package called "package"
```

executesync(script_name) `[basic: execute (sync) type: string]`<br>
Equivalent to execute(script_name), however, execution is stopped until the script we called finishes its execution.
```
executesync("foo") ; execute the script called "foo" and wait for it to finish execution

:global string status
status = "finish" ; status will only get set to "finish" after foo finishes execution
```
executesync(script_name) has a bug where, if the called script does not start execution because the conditions aren't met, executesync will continue to wait, indefinitely.<br>
If executesync does not find a valid script to execute, it will just consume 100 budget, however, if it does succeed, it will consume the rest of the budget and then consume an extra 100, leaving you with budget_cap - 100 left, where-as usually, you're left with budget_cap left.

stop(script_name) `[basic: stop type: string]`<br>
Stops the execution of all scripts and script instances which are named `script_name`.<br>
This action also clears the execution stack, which is what makes systems such as budget_exec work.

canvas.rect(where, size, color) `[canvas: draw rect type: vector(2d), type: vector(2d), type: string]`<br>
Function that's added by the software boots.d0s, which lets you draw on the canvas.<br>
Draws a square starting from the position specified in `where`, to the position correlating to `where` + `size`, of color `color`.<br>
The color is in hex code, and accepts the formats `#RGB`, `#RGBA`, `#RRGGBB` and `#RRGGBBAA`, representing the values Red Green Blue and Alpha (Opacity).

canvas.clear() `[canvas: clear]`<br>
Function that's added by the software boots.d0s, which lets you clear the canvas.<br>
Clears the canvas that's been drawn on through canvas.rect

text.set(windowID, textElementId, value) `[window: set text type: string, type: string, type: string]`<br>
Sets the content inside the window with the ID `windowID` of the text label with the id `textElementID` to `value`.

sprite.set(windowID, ElementID, sprite) `[window: set sprite type: string, type: string, type: string]`<br>
Sets the sprite inside the window with the id `windowID` of the button/image with the id `elementID` to `sprite`.

visibility.set(windowID, isVisible) `[window: set visibility type: string, type: bool]`<br>
Set the window with id ``windowID` to visible if `isVisible` is true. Otherwise, the window will be hidden.

child.visibility.set(windowID, elementID, isVisible) `[window: set child visibility type: string, type: string, type: bool]`<br>
Set child with ID `elementID` of window `windowID` to visible if `isVisible` is true. Otherwise, it will be hidden.

position.set(windowID, position) `[window: set position type: string, type: vector (2D)]`<br>
Changed the position of the window with ID `windowID` to `position` based on the anchor of its root element. Per default, the anchor is set to the genter of the window and 0, 0 represents the center of the screen.

distroy(windowID) `[window: destroy type: string]`<br>
Destroys the window with the ID `windowID`.

destroy.all() `[window: destroy all]`<br>
Ddestroys all active windows.

useinstant(spell_index) `[tower: use (instantly) type: int]`<br>
Uses the spell at slot `spell_index`, where slot 1 refers to the first skill.<br>
Entering an invalid slot will do nothing.<br>
If the spell at slot `spell_index` needs a position, useinstant will activate the spell, but you will need to click on the place to cast it.

useposition(spell_index, position) `[tower: use (position) type: int, type: vector(2D)]`<br>
Uses the spell at slot `spell_index`, where 1 refers to the first skill, at an offset of `position` of its current world position.<br>
Activate the spell and press f2 in order to get the position.

restart() `[tower: restart]`<br>
Restarts the current game of towertesting. Can only be executed after 1 second in the game has passed.<br>
restart() triggers the impulse game.newround(), so it can lead to duplication.<br>
restart() also sets enemies() to 0, which can't easily happen in endless mode, so it's a reliable way to detect if a restart has happened.

exit() `[tower: exit]`<br>
Exits the current game of towertesting and puts you back in town.

software.toggle(name, on) `[software: toggle type: string, type: bool]`<br>
