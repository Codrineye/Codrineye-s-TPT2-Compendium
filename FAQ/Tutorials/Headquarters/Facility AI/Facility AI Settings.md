`Fast Atomic functions` is a checkbox that makes all [atomic functions](AI%20Functions.md) perform their calculations instantly, as apposed to their usual behaviour where their calculations happen once per tick

`ms max. execution time per tick` is an integer field that represents the number of miliseconds permited for actions to occour in one tick.<br>
If actions halt the game for more than the inputed amount permits, the AI Overlay will shut down.

`Hide global variables in overlay` and `Hide active scripts in overlay` are checkboxes that do exactly what they say they will do.<br>
For more information on active scripts and global variables, check out [Facility AI Scripting](Facility%20AI%20Scripting.md)

Note that these settings are subject to change in the future, this is why I have made this section separate to the explanation in [Facility AI](Facility%20AI.md)
