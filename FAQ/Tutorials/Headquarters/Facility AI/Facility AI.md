# Facility AI

Facility AI is a software you can download at MT4.

This is a game mechanic that lets you program scripts using a visual probramming language, similar to Scratch.

Downloading its software provides you with a new Headquarters tab titled "Facility AI", which update the ingame tutorial and gives you access to the Facility AI interface.

# What is an AI

An AI represents a script or a package of scripts that perform the task it's programmed to do, similar to the tasks seen within the workers tab.

Unlike workers, an AI does not work while the game is closed, as they can only work with the AI Overlay enabled.

To build an AI, look at [Facility AI Scripting](Facility%20AI%20Scripting.md).

# What is a window

A window is a visual interface built in [The Custom AI Overlay editor](Facility%20AI%20windows.md)

It's used to create a more appealing method of interaction between the user and the AI.

# Facility AI Settings

Facility AI has two types of settings

The settings found in the Facility AI interface are explained in [Facility AI Settings](Facility%20AI%20Settings.md)

and the settings found under controls:

`Toggle AI` is the key you press to open the [AI Overlay](#what-is-an-ai)

`Start AI Learning (WIP)` is a work in progress feature that when activated will create a recording of your clicks<br>
The AI Learning UI is good at explaining what you can do with it.<br>
Once you finish recording, the package called "Recordings" will get a disabled script with the name `Recording (X)`, where `(X)` is the system time at which you stopped recording. (the recording creates the "Recordings" package if it's absent)

`Toggle Canvas` is the key you press to toggle the games canvas, the canvas is on by default.<br>
The canvas is used by the software `boots.dos`.

# Resources for scripts

There is no shortage of AI scripts, and you can find plenty in `Direct` [AI Scripts](<https://discord.com/channels/488444879836413975/1093895780865163284>) within this discord.

Check out the works of bluecat and yoshi in the AI scripts forum channel, since they make great scripts but haven't made collection repositorys

If you want a more detailed look into scripts, you can look at `Direct` [d0sboots AI collection](<https://github.com/d0sboots/PerfectTower>), which is a github repository made by d0sboots to hold the amazing scripts he made.

If you want a less collection of scripts made by me, I have `Redirect` [my own AI collection](/TPT2%20Scripting/README.md), a github repository that holds the scripts I've made.

And if you'd like to see the scripts made by d0sboots but within categorised folders, you can look at a clone of it called `Direct` [PerfectTower by d0sboots](https://github.com/Codrineye/PerfectTower-by-d0sboots/tree/main)

for scripting advice head over to [Facility AI Scripting](Facility%20AI%20Scripting.md) and for window creation advice, head over to [Facility AI Windows](Facility%20AI%20windows.md)
