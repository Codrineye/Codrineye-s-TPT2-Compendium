# Data Types

This folder holds every data type Facility AI has.<br>
By organizing data-types this way, it offers more freedom and it can make things easier to understand.

They are composed of input fields of type: `data_type`.

The currently docummented `data_type`'s are:
- [type: bool](./Type%20Bool.md)
- [type: double](./Type%20Double.md)
- [type: int](./Type%20Bool.md)
- [type: string](./Type%20String.md)
- [type: vector (2d)](./Type%20Vector%20(2D).md)
