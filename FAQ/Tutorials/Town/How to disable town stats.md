Surprise, it's very simple to do! It's hidden in plain sight, and people for some reason don't explore things by themselves.

1. Locate the Statistics button in the bottom row in Town.
![Find Town Stats](../../Images/Town%20Stats%20location.webp)

2. Choose an stat you want to disable. (In this case, it's Basic Resistance.)
![Sellect Desired Stat](../../Images/Sellect%20desired%20town%20stat.webp)

3. Left click on any modifiers that are present in that section. (Repeat from step 2 for every stat you want to disable.)
![Disable Desired Stat](../../Images/Disable%20desired%20town%20stats.webp)

The warning on the tooltip means that they will be enabled again once you re-enter your save file.
