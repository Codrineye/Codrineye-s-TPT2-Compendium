# Laboratory Experiment: Fire

Information and mini guide for **Experiment: Fire**

## OVERVIEW

The fire experiments overall goal is to accumulate heat to unlock modules and damage/resistance buffs.

There are 3 components to this experiment, each with 5 different tiers.\
**heaters-** produces heat every tick\
**insulators-** reduces how much heat is lost per minute\
**tickers-** increases how often a tick occurs\

Each component produces more of the tier below it, with the exception of tier 1 which actually produces the effect listed above.

Ex: a tier 3 heater produces tier 2 heaters which produces tier 1 heaters which produce heat.


## PRESTIGES

You are able to prestige when you reach a high enough heat, which causes various effects.

With the Exotic Upgrade **Fundamentals** the prestige causes
 -An increase in maximum heat 

Without this upgrade the prestige in edition to what is listed above causes
-Heat to be reset
-Heaters to be reset
-Insulators to be reset
-Tickers to be reset

There are 3 prestige upgrades you can spend your prestige points on 

**Heater Improvement**(top upgrade)- +1% production/effectivity to heaters for each manually purchased heater of the same tier
**Insulator Improvement**(bottom right upgrade)- +1% production/effectivity to insulators for each manually purchased insulator of the same tier
**Ticker Improvement**(bottom left upgrade)- +1% production/effectivity to tickers for each manually purchased ticker of the same tier

The best order to buy these order in is:
-1 point into all 3
-rest of the points in **Heater Improvement** until maxed
-no significant order for the rest
