# These are the 3 mechanics you're interested in

you get mass from the drills
you compress this mass to increase the density
if your drills are active, your density gets reset after you gain mass

# These are the 4 factors of the compressor
Modes, Maximum, Progression and Stability

The compressor has 3 modes, Quick & Qangerous, Slow & Safe, Stabilize
All of these modes are controlled via the 2 bars

The green bar represents the maximum speed the modes can achieve, the bigger the bar, the quicker it'll run

The red bar is the progress of the compressor, it slowly builds up to the maximum and slowly drains to the minimum

While compressing, you _ALWAYS_ lose stability, the modes are ordered from most stability drain to least stability drain

# What do these modes do?

- Quick & Dangerous: This mode compresses your mass in the fastest way, with the drawback that it **also** drains the stability the fastest

- Slow & Safe: This mode compresses mass in a way such that you can leave it running and you are unlikely to run out of stability before you check on it again, but remember... **THIS MODE STILL DRAINS MASS**, it just drains it a lot slower than quick and dangerous

- Stabilize: This mode does not compress your mass, it just gives your compressor stability
