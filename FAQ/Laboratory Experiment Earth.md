# The earth experiment is composed of 3 mechanics

You get mass from your drills\
You compress this mass into a dense ball to get rewards\
and most importantly, \
Your density gets reset after you gain mass

# There are 4 factors to the compressor
Compressor Modes, \
Compressor Limit, \
Compressor Startup/Shutdown \
and \
Compressor Stability

There are 3 modes, Quick & Qangerous, Slow & Safe, Stabilize\
All of which are controlled via the 2 bars

The green bar represents the maximum speed the compressor can achieve, the bigger the bar, the quicker it'll run\
The red bar is the progress the compressor has made in its startup/shutdown sequence, it slowly builds up to the maximum when active and slowly drains to the minimum when deactivated\
While compressing, you _ALWAYS_ lose stability, the modes are ordered from most stability drain to least stability drain

# What do these modes do?
![Earth Experiment Modes](https://github.com/Codrineye/Codrineye-s-TPT2-Compendium/blob/dc8a855ce0cd2da64838c325a3f759c84a4db89f/FAQ/Images/Earth%20Experiment%20Compressor%20Modes.png)

## Mode 1: Quick & Dangerous
This mode compresses your mass in the fastest way, with the drawback that it **also** drains the stability the fastest
## Mode 2: Slow & Safe
This mode compresses mass in a way such that you can leave it running and you are unlikely to run out of stability before you check on it again, but remember... **THIS MODE STILL DRAINS MASS**, it just drains it a lot slower than quick and dangerous
## Mode 3: Stabilize
This mode does not compress your mass, instead, it increases your compresors stability

# Why should I care about stability?
Stability is a crucial part of this experiment\
If your stability drops to 0% you will have to reset your experiment, which will cause you to lose:
- **ALL** your mass
- **ALL** your density
- **ALL** the progress inside of your drills

It is important to note that, tho you've lost everything, you still retain all density before you start your drils back up\
thanks to this, you are still able to collect your rewards even after your experiment requests to be reset
