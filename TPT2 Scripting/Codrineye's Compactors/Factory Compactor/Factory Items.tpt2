; 
; Everything in the list below is a valid target for automation,
; and can be assigned to the "target_type" variable in
; "lanuch factory craft".
; For example, "craft(oven, 10, "machine.oven")" indicates that
; "oven" is a valid item, usable from tiers 1-10, with the
; internal game name of "machine.oven"
; (which you don't need to worry about.)
; Thus you can enter "oven" in the box in the in-game editor
; (without the quotes).
; 

; 
; If you add or change this list, mind this constraint:
; * All the crafted items have to come before the rest of the items.
; * All the item-groups must be in a single block.
; * Prefer keeping things in alphabetical order within categories,
;   because they are ordered the same way when presented in-game.

; 
; --- SCANNABLE ITEM GROUPS ---
; These are not real items, but rather groups of items that will
; be made together if you select one of these names.
; They are meant for use with the Crafter, to crank out sets of items
; to scan quickly. You will want to set the quantity to 1000.
; 

; 
; Notes on using item groups:
; * SCAN YOUR ORES FIRST! The factory can and **will**
;   consume your ore to make stuff, and
;   it takes a long time to get 1000 T10 ore.
; * The quantity works a little differently than normal items.
;   Instead of making 1000 items each time, running it again
;   will top off everything to be *at* the quantity of 1000 items.
; * If you craft a higher tier after a lower tier, it will
;   consume the results of the first craft to make the higher tier.
;   Scan all the items first, before moving on to the next tier!
; * None of these groups include Gem Producers or Exotic Producers.
;   They are too expensive in comparison to other things,
;   craft them on your own when you judge the time is right.
; 

; 
; Makes *everything* (expect special producers and lumps) of
; the given tier.
; This is the combination of "chips_and_prods", "machines", and "parts".
; Requires x10 and high processing speed to have a hope of completing
; in a reasonable amount of time for T5 and T10.
; You need Quantum Warehouse to have enough space for
; this at higher tiers!
