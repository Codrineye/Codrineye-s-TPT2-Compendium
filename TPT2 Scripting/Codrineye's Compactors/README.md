# Codrineye's Compactors
Codrineye's Compactors are scripts formed out of 3 parts

## The compactor
The compactor is a lua macro that orders the needed data into a single string

## The configuration script
The configuration script is the space in which the user comunicates with the lua macro

## The reading script
The reading script is the end result program that uses the compacted data to finalize the result

# But why
The compactors are formed to condense tasks that could span several scripts into one single script<br>
Using a compactor takes away a lot of the headache that comes with programming lengthy operations to go smoothly, and diverts it my way<br>
The compactor is first and foremost a quality of life improvement for those who want to perform lengthy tasks
