wakeup()
; This script will start once the user first activates the AI overlay.
; As scripts outside of packages are executed before scripts in packages,
; we guarantee that every package that uses our library start
; after budget_exec_var has been initialized
; 

gotoif(end, impulse() != "wakeup")
; We kill the instance if our impulse wasn't wakeup, as we've already initialized the variable
;
; If we're here, we want to initialize budget_exec_var by starting up our package.
; If budget_exec_var is empty after this initialization,
; the script that uses this package will show an error
execute("{accelerate_budget}")
;
end:
; Stop the instance to remove us from the execution stack.
; Minor optimisation but still worth it
;
; This addition still works, even with a budget cap of 100 because the gotoif()
; run by our accelerator starts the instance that kills us
