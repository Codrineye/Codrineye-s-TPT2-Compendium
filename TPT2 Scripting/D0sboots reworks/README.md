# D0sboots reworks

These are sets of scripts based on those found on the [PerfectTower](https://github.com/d0sboots/PerfectTower?tab=readme-ov-file#readme) repo by d0sboots, where I re-build them from the ground up.

All scripts that require speed have [budget_exec](../Budget%20Exec/README.md) as a dependency. This is the equivalent to Turbo Exec in d0s's scripts.
