; How to museum
;
; The script will only ever buy stones from the offshore market (if unlocked).
; The formula to calculate the cost to buy a tier from the offshore market = `2000 * 18 ^ tier`
;
; Since we can now have the exact number of museum resources on hand, we no longer have to wait
; because of a lack of budget, as it can simply uptier the ammount that it needs.
;
;
; Similar to the original script by d0sboots. We need to keep a list of offer tiers, but this time
; since we no longer have to include that lack of budget fail state, the offer_tiers list will
; need to hold more tiers.
; The new encoding would be stone element, followed by a length-1 0 through 9 marker that represents
; how many offers we found for that element (n - 1), and then
; n-1 length-2 chunks that hold the offer tiers.
; If no such offers were found, the entry will not exist.
;
; We'll need to order these lists from highest to lowest, so that we can get the highest to lowest
; prices. Since we also want to minimise the number of global variables created, these must all be
; within the same variable.
;
; For the sake of efficiency, there'll also need to be a cutoff point, where it'd be more beneficial
; to buy a lower tier stone instead of a higher tier stone. Idealy, this would only need to happen
; when we can't buy enough of the highest tier to uptier for a higher combination, but buying
; a lower tier could also just make things worse.
;
; For future work, it'd be the best to determine if clearing the inventory would still be needed.
