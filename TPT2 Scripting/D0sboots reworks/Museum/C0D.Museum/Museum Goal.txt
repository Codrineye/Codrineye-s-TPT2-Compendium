; The goal is to try an uptier all stones in the loadout
;
; We use museum_slot to traverse the loadout (which is indexed by 0)
; Once we find a slot with a stone, we clear our inventory and place it in slot 0 of the inventory
; The inventory has 30 slots and it takes 3 stones of the same tier to combine in 1 tier higher
; Thus, we have (30 - 1) free slots and divide them by (3 - 1) stones to uptier = 29 / 2
; 29 / 2 = 14.5 = 14 uptiers (since the stone tier is an integer)
;
; the function combine requires the user to unlock the skill `quick combine`
; Combine starts from slot 0 and looks for the next 3 stones of the same tier,
; then it combines them and places the result at the empty slot in the inventory, thus
; we can guarantee that the highest tier stone is in slot 0
;
;
; The primary goal is to fill our inventory
