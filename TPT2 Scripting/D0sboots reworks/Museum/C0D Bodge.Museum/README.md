To maximize the potential of the\n; range, we want the top and bottom of the range to have equally high max_tiers,\n; so max_tier(pref - 10.5) = max_tier(pref + .5).

There's a lot of cases to this:\n; * Error for no workers available.\n;   - We don't have direct visibilty to worker_slot, but Buy will signal the\n;     error by setting budget to negative, which will never happen otherwise.\n; * Error for a bad Turbo install. This is disturbingly frequent.\n; * Show our current budget, with green highlighting to prompt that this\n;   can be adjusted.\n; * Show a brief help line, also with green highlighting to link the keys\n;   to the budget.\n; * If we've pressed {start}, show the Combining message instead. This is\n;   important because certain things key off of it. target_tier = -2 is the\n;   signal for this.\n;\n; We don't bother doing anything special when the museum isn't open, since\n; we'll handle that at the bottom of the script.\nmuseum_status = if(\\\n  gdg({budget}) < 0.,\\\n  \"</size>error=<color=#fb3>No available workers!</color>\",\\\n  \"</size>museum=<color=#2f4>\" . {rounded_budget} .\\\n    \"</color> <color=#fff>budget</color><br>\\\n<color=#0df><color=#2f4>{up}</color>/<color=#2f4>{down}</color> changes, <color=#2f4>{start}</color> \" .\\\n  if(\\\n    museum_tier != -2,\\\n    \"begins</color>\",\\\n    \"stops</color><br><color=#fff>Waiting \" .\\\n    {time_floor(60.)} . \":\" . sub(d2s({time_floor(1.)} % 60. + 100.), 1, 2) .\\\n    \"</color>\"\\\n  )\\\n)\n; The s2i()/sub() expression is a jump-table, where the string values are\n; line numbers.\n; The values that target_tier can have when we get here are 0\n; (if it hasn't been set to anything since it was cleared at the top of\n; status_loop), -2 (set when key.{start} is pressed), and -3 (set when\n; budget is adjusted via key.{up}/key.{down}).\n;\n; -2 finishes the loop. -3 should reset target_tier and update status by\n; jumping two lines back. 0 *could* repeat the same line, except sometimes\n; we have to update status, so we jump one back, to set status.\n; We can't merge the -3 and 0 cases, because setting target_tier over-frequently\n; makes keystrokes flaky.\n;\n; We use a modified jump table when museum_tier is -2, which indicates that\n; we are synced to the refresh timer. In that case, we abort when the timer is\n; 59:59 (meaning the refresh just hapenned), and when start is pressed (-2 for\n; target_tier) we jump back to executing Buy, which will reset museum_tier\n; (and also do other things, which we don't care about) in that case.\ngoto(if(\\\n  isopen(\"museum\"),\\\n  if(\\\n    museum_tier == -2 && {timer} >= 59. * 60. + 59.,\\\n    start_museum,\\\n    wait_frame\\\n  ),\\\n  end\\\n))\n\nwait_frame:\nwaitframe()\ngoto(if(\\\n  target_tier == -2,\\\n  if(museum_tier == -2, top, start_museum),\\\n  if(\\\n    target_tier == -3,\\\n    status_loop,\\\n    if(target_tier == 0, status_loop + 1, last_end)\\\n  )\\\n))\n\nstart_museum:\n; Now that we're in the active part of the script, start turbo.

Combine will exit immediately in that case, without a frame break,\n; so we will fall down below and set the status correctly within the frame\n; that it starts.\nexecute(\"{script(Calculate)}\")\n\n; Combine (which gets run from Calculate) will signal us when it's done.\n; It must be stopped for proper cleanup.\nwaituntil(museum_tier == -5)\nstop(\"{script(Combine)}\")\n\nskip:\nmuseum_tier = -2\nmuseum_pos += 1\n; While running, we have fewer conditions to check, since the errors were\n; already signaled at the top.
