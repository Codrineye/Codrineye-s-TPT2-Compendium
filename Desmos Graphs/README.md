[Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/) has a [Graphing Calculator](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) that lets you plot equations on an xy axis grid. This is useful in general, but it can also help with TPT2 scripting.

Some scripts in TPT2 require UI dependent operations such as clicks, scrolling and painting on the canvas. To verify valid coordinates, you can use a desmos graph to simulate the game screen and, by proxy, the behaveour you're looking to implement.

For ease of use, I've created the library ["Perfect Tower lib"](Perfect%20Tower%20lib.md) that you can import into your graph to obtain a UI and Facility AI functions. For more information on what the library adds, please go to its markdown file liked above and [here](Perfect%20Tower%20lib.md).
